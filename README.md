## SPICED Academy /// Week 02 /// Logistic Regression<br><br>
Within the second week of SPICED Academy, I conducted a machine learning model on the famous "Titanic" dataset. 
After an extensive exploratory data analysis, I chose to focus on a couple of features only. 
These features included demographic  ("Age", "Sex"), socioeconomic ("Fare", "Passenger`s class) and social characteristics ("Number of siblings/spouses aboard", "Number of parents/children aboard"). 

Afterwards, three machine learning models were conducted, all of them making use of logistic regression. Gradually, I stacked the number of features and continuously added more features with each model. Meaning that the first machine learning model only included demographic features, the second model also included sociodemograic features, and the third model also included social features.
<br><br>Additionally, various machine learning models were applied and their performance ranking was compared, just for the purpose of fun.
